# NimsLips - Lipstick Recommendation Website

## 🎨 Project Overview

NimsLips is a lipstick recommendation website developed as part of a Web Hackathon - WebCraft 2k24 at our college. My friend and I worked on this project together: she handled the design, and I took care of the coding. Our goal is to create a user-friendly platform where users can select lipstick shades and see them on a demo lips display.

**Current Status:** Incomplete, with basic structure in place.
